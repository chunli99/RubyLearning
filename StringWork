#todo:
 #    What could you do to make sure your redactor redacts a word regardless of whether it's upper case or lower case?
 #   How could you make your program take multiple, separate words to REDACT?
 #   How might you make a new redacted string and save it as a variable, rather than just printing it to the console?


puts "What's the word to be redacted?"
    text = gets.chomp
    
words = text.split(" ")

words.each do |word|
    if word == redact
        print "REDACTED "
    else
        print word + " "
    end
end
